# Evolution of Todo (Phase I: Python Console App) Constitution

## Core Principles

### Logic-First Architecture
Use 'logic-specialist' for core CRUD operations. All business logic must be encapsulated in dedicated logic modules that are independent of user interface concerns. Logic modules must be self-contained, testable, and reusable.

### UX-Driven Interactions
Use 'ux-specialist' for terminal interactions. All user interface concerns must be handled by dedicated UX modules that focus on user experience and presentation. UX modules must be decoupled from business logic to allow for interface flexibility.

### Input Validation Guardianship
Apply 'skill-validation-guardianship' to all user inputs. All user inputs must be validated, sanitized, and verified before processing. Input validation must be comprehensive and follow security best practices to prevent injection and other vulnerabilities.

### Modular Code Architecture
All code must be modular to support transition to Phase II (FastAPI/SQLModel). Code components must be designed with clear interfaces and minimal dependencies to enable seamless migration to web-based architecture. Modularity is essential for maintainability and scalability.

### Code Quality Standards
Maintain 100% adherence to PEP 8 and clean code principles. All code must follow Python style guidelines, use meaningful names, maintain appropriate function lengths, and follow established Python conventions. Code quality is non-negotiable for long-term maintainability.

### Feature Completeness
Successfully implement 5 core features: Add, View, Update, Delete, Mark Complete. The application must provide complete functionality for managing todo items through these fundamental operations. Each feature must be fully functional and properly tested.

## Technology Stack and Development Standards
The project utilizes Python 3.13+ with the UV package manager. All development follows Spec-Driven Development methodology with no manual code edits. The codebase must be structured to support transition to Phase II with FastAPI and SQLModel.

## Development Workflow and Quality Assurance
Development follows a structured workflow with governance by architect-prime who is responsible for roadmap and SDD compliance. All changes must be tested and validated before integration. Quality gates ensure adherence to architectural principles and coding standards.

## Governance
This constitution governs all development activities for the Evolution of Todo project. All code changes, architectural decisions, and feature implementations must comply with the principles outlined in this document. Amendments to this constitution require explicit approval from the lead architect.
